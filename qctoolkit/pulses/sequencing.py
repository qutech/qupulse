class Sequencer:

    The concept of the sequencing process itself is described in detail in Section 1.4 of the
    documentation. Sequencer controls the process and invokes the translation functions of
    SequencingElements on the sequencing stack, which in turn implement the details of the
    translation of that specific SequencingElement.

    Sequencer manages a main InstructionBlock into which all instructions are translated by default.
    Since additional InstructionBlocks may be created during the sequencing process due to looping
    and branching, Sequencer maintains several several sequencing stacks - one for each block -
    simultaneously and continues the translation until no stack holds objects that may be
    translated anymore before compiling the final sequence and interrupting or finishing the
    sequencing process.
